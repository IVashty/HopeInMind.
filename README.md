### Lastly
> __Thank You__ to ALX-SWE for giving me the opportunity to showcase the skills that I have learned in the past 9 months. Without the support and guidance of mentors and peers , this project would not have been possible. I am grateful for providing me with a platform to grow and develop as a programmer.
